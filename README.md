# RAG Templates 

This repository provides a collection of template notebooks showcasing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with different Large Language Models (LLMs). Each notebook demonstrates RAG implementation using a specific LLM for response retrieval.

## **What's Included:**

* **RAG OpenAI:** This notebook utilizes OpenAI's GPT for retrieving information to augment response generation.
* **RAG Google:** This notebook leverages Google's Gemini LLM for the retrieval stage of the RAG pipeline.
* (Add more notebooks as you implement them with different LLMs)

## **Benefits:**

* **Rapid Prototyping:** These notebooks serve as a starting point for quickly building and testing RAG applications with various LLMs.
* **Flexibility:** Easily swap out the LLM in each notebook to explore the capabilities of different models.
* **Code Examples:** Learn best practices for implementing RAG with clear code examples in each notebook.

## **Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mohamedhassan218/RAG-templates.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Each notebook contains it's needed dependencies you'll need to run it's cells.

3. **Run a Notebook:**

Open a Jupyter Notebook environment and navigate to the desired notebook file within the repository. Run the notebook cells to execute the RAG application with the corresponding LLM.

You can also use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
