# RAG Templates 

This repository provides a collection of template notebooks showcasing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with different Large Language Models (LLMs). Each notebook demonstrates RAG implementation using a specific LLM for response retrieval.

## **What is RAG?**

## **What's included in this repo?**

* **RAG OpenAI:** this notebook utilizes OpenAI's GPT for retrieving information to augment response generation. Get your API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (paid).
* **RAG Google:** this notebook leverages Google's Gemini LLM for the retrieval stage of the RAG pipeline. Get your API key from [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) (free).
* **RAG Cohere:** this notebook uses Cohere's `command-r` model for the retrieving stage. Get your API key from [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) (free).

## **Benefits**

* **Rapid Prototyping:** these notebooks serve as a starting point for quickly building and RAG applications with various LLMs.
* **Flexibility:** easily swap out the LLM in each notebook to explore the capabilities of different models.
* **Code Examples:** learn best practices for implementing RAG with clear code examples in each notebook.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mohamedhassan218/RAG-templates.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Each notebook contains it's needed dependencies you'll need to run it's cells.

3. **Run a Notebook:**

Open a Jupyter Notebook environment and navigate to the desired notebook file within the repository. Run the notebook cells to execute the RAG application with the corresponding LLM.

You can also use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
